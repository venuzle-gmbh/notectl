The `BlockquotePlugin` adds block quote support with a toggle command, keyboard shortcut, and Markdown-style input rule.

A blockquote is a **container block**: it wraps other blocks rather than holding text directly. A single quote can contain paragraphs, headings, lists, and even nested blockquotes, mirroring the HTML semantics of `<blockquote>` as flow content. This means you can quote a whole list or a multi-block passage without losing its structure.

## Container model

Toggling blockquote on a selection **wraps** every selected top-level block into one shared blockquote; toggling it off **lifts** those blocks back out. Wrapping preserves the wrapped blocks exactly, so list markers, heading levels, and inline marks survive the operation.

```text
blockquote
  heading   "Quarterly goals"
  paragraph "We agreed on three priorities:"
  list_item "Ship the editor"
  list_item "Write the docs"
```

Because a blockquote holds blocks, its text lives one level deeper than a plain block. When reading content programmatically, descend into the child blocks (for example via `getBlockChildren`) rather than expecting text directly on the blockquote.

## Usage

```ts
import { BlockquotePlugin } from '@venuzle/notectl/plugins/blockquote';

new BlockquotePlugin()
```

## Configuration

```ts
interface BlockquoteConfig {
  /** Live Markdown shortcut `> ` to start a blockquote. Default: true */
  readonly inputRule?: boolean;
  /** Custom locale strings. */
  readonly locale?: BlockquoteLocale;
}
```

## Commands

| Command | Description | Returns |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `toggleBlockquote` | Wrap the selected blocks into a blockquote, or lift them out if they are already quoted | `boolean` |
| `setBlockquote` | Wrap the selected blocks into a blockquote (no toggle-off) | `boolean` |

```ts
// Select several blocks, then wrap them all into one quote:
editor.executeCommand('toggleBlockquote');
```

With a multi-block selection, every selected block is wrapped into a single blockquote. Running `toggleBlockquote` again from inside the quote lifts the blocks back to the top level.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+>` / `Cmd+Shift+>` | Toggle blockquote |

## Input Rules

| Pattern | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `> ` (at the start of a paragraph) | Wrap the paragraph into a blockquote |

## Keyboard Behavior

Caret navigation works at the two container boundaries; everything in between behaves like normal block editing.

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `Enter` | Empty last child of the quote | Exit the quote and start a paragraph after it (dissolves the quote if it was the only child) |
| `Enter` | Any other child | Split normally, creating a new line inside the quote |
| `Backspace` | Start of the first child | Lift that child out, before the quote (dissolves the quote if it was the only child) |
| `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` | At a container edge | Cross into or out of the quote (native caret movement) |

A blockquote never persists empty: lifting or exiting its last child dissolves the container.

## Node Spec

| Type | HTML Tag | Content | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `blockquote` | `<blockquote>` | block children | Container that wraps paragraphs, headings, lists, and nested blockquotes |

The `content` rule allows block children (`paragraph`, `heading`, `list_item`, `blockquote`, `horizontal_rule`, `code_block`), so a quote can hold structured content. It is intentionally **not** `isolating`, so the caret flows in and out across its edges.

The `toDOM` method creates a `<blockquote>` element with the required `data-block-id` attribute and `part="blockquote"` for shadow-part targeting. Child blocks render recursively inside it (lists become `<ul>`/`<ol>`, headings keep their level), and `dir`/`align` on the container round-trip through HTML. The editor's default styles render a left border and padding for visual distinction.

## Theming

The blockquote participates in the [three-tier theming cascade](/notectl/guides/styling/#theming-contract-three-tier-cascade). Setting the global `--notectl-border` still recolors the left bar alongside other borders; the component-scoped tokens override only the blockquote:

```css
notectl-editor {
  --notectl-blockquote-border: #6366f1;
  --notectl-blockquote-bg: #f5f3ff;
  --notectl-blockquote-fg: #4338ca;
}
```

| Token | Default fallback |
|---|---|
| `--notectl-blockquote-border` | `var(--notectl-border)` |
| `--notectl-blockquote-bg` | `transparent` |
| `--notectl-blockquote-fg` | `inherit` |

Alternatively, use [`::part(blockquote)`](/notectl/guides/styling/#shadow-parts) for structural styling beyond what tokens cover:

```css
notectl-editor::part(blockquote) {
  font-style: italic;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```
